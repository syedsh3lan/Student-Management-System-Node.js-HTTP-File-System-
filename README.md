Project Title: Student Management System (Node.js HTTP + File System)

Description: This Node.js project is a basic student management system that handles CRUD operations for students, their departments, and associated courses. The project utilizes the following:
Node.js HTTP Module: For setting up the server and handling different HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
File System (fs): For reading from and writing to JSON files that store the data for students, departments, and courses.
Event-Driven Architecture: Using emit and on methods to handle custom events like data for processing and managing server-side actions asynchronously.
The project demonstrates how to manage file-based data storage and handle different types of requests (CRUD operations) without using any external databases.

Features:
Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) students, departments, and courses.
Event-driven approach using Node.js' built-in events (emit and on).
File-based storage for persistent data using JSON files.
